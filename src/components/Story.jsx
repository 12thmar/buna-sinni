            Our mission is to honor Ethiopian tradition while meeting the highest standards in specialty coffee.
            Each cup tells a storyâ€”of people, land, and legacy. We work directly with smallholder farmers and
            cooperatives across Sidama, Yirgacheffe, and Guji.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
            From sun-drying on raised beds to meticulous hand-sorting, every step is rooted in craft.
            Importing directly from these communities ensures fair compensation and truly traceable,
            single-origin coffee with a purpose.
